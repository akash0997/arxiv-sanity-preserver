This project is a fork of https://github.com/karpathy/arxiv-sanity-preserver.

I am trying to better understand this application as well as trying to simplify the javascript using React. I am also working on giving it a better design using bulma.css

My main aim of this project is to understand data engineering and be deeply involved with open-source.
