This project is a fork of https://github.com/karpathy/arxiv-sanity-preserver.

I am trying to better understand this application as well as trying to simplify the javascript using React. I am also working on giving it a better design using bulma.css

My main aim of this project is to understand the data engineering involved and be deeply involved with open-source.

I have incorporated create-react-app in this project. Most of the React projects are under the src/ folder.

To run this project, follow instructions in data_engineering.md. Make sure you have mongodb installed and running.

You will also have to do `npm install` in the project root directory to install all node_modules.

Then run `npm run build` to build the static production css and javascript files.

 After that, run the flask server by typing `python serve.py`. Then visit http://localhost:5000. The project should appear there.
